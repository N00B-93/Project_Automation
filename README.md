This Repository contains a bash script named "automation.sh" which was created with the aim to 
automate the process of doing ALXSE project so as to reduce the stress of students having to type in so many commands
in the process of doing their projects.

The script was written on ubuntu 22.04 LTS and only works for a bash shell, a version for other shell will be available in the nearest future.

To use the script, clone the repository in your terminal and copy "automation.sh" into the directory that you want to 
work in.

A short demonstration video on how to use this script is available in my YouTube channel(link below).

Also please note that this is a prototype version and the script will be further improved on. Kindly use it and share your 
views on how it works and what you think can be done to improve how it works.

You can drop your comments on my YouTube channel, i'm looking forward to hearing from you all.
